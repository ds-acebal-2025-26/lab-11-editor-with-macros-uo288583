Single Responsibility Principle: 
Each command is now encapsulated in its own class, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
Open/Closed Principle: Adding new commands is as simple as creating a new class and 
registering it in the CommandHandler.

Command Pattern:
The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object,
allowing you to parameterize objects with different requests, queue or log requests,
and support undoable operations.

How the Command Pattern is Applied:
Command Interface:
The UserCommand interface defines a common method (execute) that all commands must implement.
This ensures that all commands have a uniform way of being executed.

Concrete Command Classes:
Each command (e.g., OpenCommand, InsertCommand, DeleteCommand, etc.) is implemented as a
separate class. These classes encapsulate the logic for their respective operations.

Invoker:
The CommandHandler class acts as the invoker. It stores a mapping of command names to their
respective UserCommand implementations and delegates the execution of commands.

Receiver:
The TextEditor class acts as the receiver. It performs the actual operations 
(e.g., insert, delete, replace) when the commands are executed.
